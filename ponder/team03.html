        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will review the built in array methods. This was
          borrowed from a free javascript course from Wes Bos
          <a href="https://javascript30.com" target="_blank">Javascript30</a>.
          If you sign up you will get access to video solutions for all of the
          exercises...including the one that this activity is based on: Array
          Cardio Day 1. If you decide to sign up (I actually would recommend
          this)...try them all first before looking at the solutions!
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a href="../solutions/week03/index-FINISHED.html" target="_blank"

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
