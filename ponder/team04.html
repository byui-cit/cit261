        <p>
          This activity will review DOM manipulation with Javascript and events.

          from Javascript: Novice to Ninja). We will do this by building an
          HTML/CSS/JS based Tic-Tac-Toe board.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Build a 3X3 board in HTML and CSS.
              </p>
              <p>
                You could do this with either a table element, or a collection
                of divs. Both have their advantages and disadvantages.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Attach a <code>touchend</code> listener to the board.</p>
              <p>
                When a cell is touched it should add either an 'X or an 'O',
                depending on whether it is player 1 or player 2's turn.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Add a reset button.
              </p>
              <p>
                When touched the reset button should remove all of the marks
                from the board.
              </p>
              <!-- END STEP -->

              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                If your board looks like the first image below, make it look
                like the second.

              <p>
                Hint: look into <code>:nth-child(n)</code>,
                <code>:last-child</code>, etc for help to target specific cells
                to turn borders on or off.

              <p>Add Game logic</p>
              <p>
                Right now the players have to decide who won, or whether it was
                a tie. Add some game logic to figure out when the game should
                result in a tie.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Add More Game logic</p>
              <p>
                Add the logic to figure out when someone wins.

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
