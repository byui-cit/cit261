        <h1>Ponder Team Activity: Working with a remote API</h1>
        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will introduce you to working with a remote API. We will
          use Fetch with promises to do this here. These are both new additions
          to Javascript with ES2015. This could also be done more traditionally
          with an XMLHTTPRequest and callbacks. The API we will be comsuming is
          <a href="https://swapi.co/" target="_blank">SWAPI</a>: Star Wars API.
          We will pull data in batches, then build a pagination UI to display
          it.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          FYI. If Star Wars is not your thing you could also complete this
          activity with the
          <a href="https://pokeapi.co/" target="_blank">PokeAPI</a>
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code and everyone
          successfully deploys the code to their individual Heroku accounts.
          Each week let someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>

          <h3>Core Requirements</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Take a look at the
                <a href="https://swapi.co/documentation" target="_blank"
                  >documentation</a
                >
                for the api first. It gives good examples of how to make calls
                to each endpoint, and shows the structure of the data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Create a basic application and use <code>fetch</code> to pull a
                list of people or ships. Display this list in the browser
                window.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                If you made a request to
                <kbd>https://swapi.co/api/people</kbd>, for example, it will
                tell you that there are 87 different people in the
                database...but it will only send you 10 of them! It is sending
                back the data in such a way to facilitate viewing it in small
                chunks...paginated. It also gives a <kbd>next</kbd> url.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use the <kbd>next</kbd> and <kbd>prev</kbd> urls to build a UI
                with next and prev buttons to move back and forth between pages
                of results.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Style it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Consider your target...a small mobile screen. What will be the
                best way to present the items returned? Style your paginated
                list to work well on a mobile screen.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
          <ol class="bigSteps">
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>
                Get the details
              </p>

              <p>
                When we touch an item in your list (people, ships, etc) it would
                be good if it showed us the full details for that item. Make it
                so.
              </p>

              <!-- END STEP -->
            </li>
            <li>
              <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
              <p>Skip to page</p>
              <p>
                Add a button to your paginated list for each page in the results
                set that will let you jump straight to that page. For example if
                the results set had 57 items in it...and you got 10 at a time,
                you would have 6 pages of results.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

        <h2>Instructors Solution</h2>
        <p>
          As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a
          solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one.
          One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide
          insights from this comparison.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this
          activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if
          you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are
          welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you
          complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help
          you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core
          requirements, if you code them up yourself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After working with your team for the one hour activity,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/solutions/week05"

          >.

        <h2>Submission</h2>
        <p>
          When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment
          in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this
          activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before
          submitting the assessment.
