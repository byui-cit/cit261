        <hr />
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This activity will give you an opportunity to share what you are doing
          with your teammates...and hopefully get some feedback or suggestions
          at the same time. This weeks activity will probably take less than an
          hour.
        </p>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
          Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member
          as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code.
          Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code
          and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make
          sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code. Each week let
          someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.
        </p>
