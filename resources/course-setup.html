              <h3>Code Editor</h3>
              <p>
                It is important that you have a good code editor and that you
                spend some time learning how to use it. For this course it is
                recommended that you use the
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank"
                  >VS Code</a
                >
                editor. Download and install it now if you do not have it.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would also recommend reviewing
                <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs" target="_blank"
                  >some of the documentation</a
                >
                if you have not.
              </p>

              <h3>Node/NPM</h3>
              <p>Have each member of the team install the current LTS (Long Term
              Support) version of node. Follow the instructions for your
              operating system found in
              <a

              <p class="callout">
                Make sure that you are familiar with how to use the command
                prompt for your operating system. Here are some quickstarts for
                the

              <h3>Github</h3>
              <p>Each person should also have an account at <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>

              <h3>Microsoft Teams</h3>
              <p>A Microsoft Team has been setup for this course, and you should have been added to it. Download <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/microsoft-teams/download-app" target="_blank">Teams</a> and sign in with your university account. You should see a team named <kbd>WDD330.x semester</kbd> (If it were Fall 2020, and you are in section 1 the name would be <kbd>WDD330.01 F20</kbd>). Post a message in the General channel indicating that you are in.</p>
             
              <!-- END STEP -->

            <li>
                <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
                <h3>Form a Team</h3>
                <p>Much of the work for the course will be done in a team. Form a team with 2-3 of your classmates (total team size should be 3-4). If you have trouble finding a team talk to the instructor. Once your team is formed, send an email to the instructor with the names of the members in your team.</p>
                <p>Remember that everyone should be in Teams now as well...you could post a message there: 'looking for team'</p>
                <p>If you would like a private channel for your team in Teams, let the instructor know in your email.</p>

                <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
                <h3>Trello</h3>
                <p>Each person should also create an account at <a href="https://trello.com" target="_blank">Trello</a>. We will be using a Trello board to manage the team project. One person in the team should visit <a href="https://trello.com/b/LO93bmJy/sleepoutside" target="_blank">this trello board</a>, and <a href="https://help.trello.com/article/802-copying-cards-lists-or-boards" target="_blank">copy</a> it to their account.</p>
                <p>Then that person should invite the other team members to the board so they can edit it.</p>
