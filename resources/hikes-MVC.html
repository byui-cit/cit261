        <h1>Hikes: Model-View-Controller</h1>
        <hr />

        <p>
          Here is a simple implementation of the MVC architecture of our Hikes
          app. It will also show examples of using classes and ESModules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by creating a simple HTML file. You can use the code below as a
          starting point.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="html">
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Great Hikes&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" /&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;main&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Great Hikes&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;ul id="hikeList" &gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;/main&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
        </code></pre>
        <p>
          Create one more file: <kbd>index.js</kbd> and add it with a script
          element into your HTML.
        </p>

            <h3>MVC</h3>
            <p>
              Before we take the next steps, let's think a moment about how we
              would like to organize our code. Not taking this time will almost
              always produce what is known as "spaghetti code." This code is hard to
              follow, maintain, and understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this project we will use the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
              architecture. It provides a nice separation of concerns and will
              help us stay organized. This is a simple application and so we
              will probably only need one model, one view, and one controller.
              Create three more files in your project called:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><kbd>HikeModel.js</kbd></li>
              <li><kbd>HikesView.js</kbd></li>
              <li><kbd>HikesController.js</kbd></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In MVC, models are responsible to handle all of the interactions
              with our data source. They often contain schema information
              describing the data as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Views take information (usually from the Model) and display it in
              whatever format is needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Controllers act as the glue between the model and view. Their job
              is to request information from the model when needed, and pass it
              on to the view to be displayed.
            </p>

            <h3>HikeModel.js</h3>
            <p>
              Let's begin by building the model: HikeModel.js. We will use a
              <kbd>class</kbd> to represent our model. There is a bit of
              code provided to get you started. Copy it into your file.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
// Normally the model would have more going on, like retrieving the hikes from a database, adding hikes, editing hikes, filtering, etc. Our model will be very simple. We could export the hikeList, but a better pattern would be to create a "getter" function to do it instead. That way as our model changed, we could change the getter function and anything using it should be able to remain the same.
const hikeList = [

              Notice the included list of hike data at the top for you to work

              Now let's move on to the view. The view should get sent some data,
              then format it and display it in the current page. As before, we
              will use a class, and a head start is provided:
            </p>

            <h3>HikesController.js</h3>
            <p>
              Remember that the Controller is like the
              glue between the Model and View? Well in order to do that, the
              Controller has to know about both. Making our model and view using
              Classes and modules will make it easy to do that. As before,
              copy and paste the code below into your controller to get started.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
import HikeModel from './HikeModel.js';
import HikesView from './HikesView.js';

// Hike controller
export default class HikesController {
  constructor(parentId) {
    this.parentElement = document.getElementById(parentId); 
    // this is how our controller will know about the model and view...we add them right into the class as members.
    this.hikeModel = new HikeModel();
    this.hikesView = new HikesView(parentId);
  }
  
  showHikeList() {
    //  This will get called each time we need to display our full hike list. It should grab the list of hikes from the Model, and then send them to the view.
  }

  showOneHike(hikeName) {
    // Use this when you need to show just one hike with full details.
    
  }
  addHikeListener() {
    // For the stretch you will need to attach a listener to each of the listed hikes to watch for a touchend. 
   
  }
}
            </code></pre>

            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
            <p>
              The next step is to let our HTML know about our modules. In the
              <kbd>index.js</kbd> file import in your Controller, create an
              instance of the class, then call the
              <code>showHikeList()</code> method. You may want to console.log
              something out from that method until we create it to help us know
              if everything is working correctly. If there are errors, fix them.
              If not move on to the next step. Make sure that
              <code>showHikeList()</code> does not get called before the DOM is
              ready.
            </p>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Finishing up</h3>
            <p>
              The last step is to go back in our model, view, and controller and
              finish writing the methods as indicated in the comments. It is
              recommended that you start with the Model. Complete the
              <code>getAllHikes</code> method first (model), test it, then move
              on to the <code>showAllHikes</code> and
              <code>renderHikeList</code> methods. Test again.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that work on the controller or View methods as it makes
              sense. Follow the same order finish a
              method, then test. It will keep your errors under control and make
              your code easier to troubleshoot.

            <h3>Stretch Goals (optional)</h3>
            <p>
              If you want to take this further, there are lots of improvements
              that could be made.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                It would be great if we could specify the radius we would like
                to include in the query for earthquakes. Make it so. You might
                also allow the use to indicate the dates they would like to
                search over as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                The styling leaves a lot to be desired on this project. Style it
                up! Make it look and work better.
              </li>
              <li>
                We can dig into a quake's details, but we currently have
                no way to get back to the list other than a refresh of the page.
                Add a "Back" button.
              </li>
              <li>
                What if we wanted to add more functionality? A Routing system
                would make this easier. See if you can take the
                <a

                from the SPA example app that we did earlier and integrate it
                into this app.
