        <hr />

        <p>
          At this point we have learned a lot about coding with Javascript.
          Let's make a simple earthquake watch app to apply what we have
          learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by creating a simple HTML file. You can use the code below as a
          starting point.

            <p>
              We will be fetching data from an external API using
              <kbd>fetch</kbd>. All of the data we will be requesting will be in
              the <kbd>JSON</kbd> format, so let's write a helper function to
              automatically convert the response to that, and add a bit of extra
              error checking as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open the <kbd>utilities.js</kbd> file and create a function called
              <kbd>getJSON(url)</kbd>. Add the code to make your function do a
              simple fetch request using the <kbd>url</kbd> argument that should
              get passed in, and return the response in JSON.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use

                We will be using earthquake data from the USGS. They have an
                open api that is easy to use. You can find the documentation
                here:

              <h3>Simple Fetch</h3>
              <div>
                <pre><code class="javascript">
function getJSON(url) {
    return fetch(url)
        .then(function(response) {
            return response.json();
        })
}
                </code></pre>
              </div>
            </section>
            <p>
              This is a good start, but it is a bit brittle. Let's add some
              error checking. You should have used a <code>.then()</code> method
              call to process the response of your request. There is another
              method we can use as well: <code>.catch()</code>. We can use this
              to do some checking on how successful our fetch was. We can just
              chain this method after the end of the <code>.then()</code> call.
              Like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
.catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
});
        </code></pre>
            <p>
              This is a very simple error handler. Normally you would do
              something about the error, instead of just reporting it. The
              problem with this however, is that Fetch was designed to treat
              <em>any</em> request that communicates successfully with the
              intended destination server as successful, no matter what the
              response is! So we need to add more checking to make sure we
              actually got the results we were looking for before we try to use
              them. Luckily the Fetch response includes an <code>ok</code> flag
              as part of the response. If that is <kbd>true</kbd>, then we get
              got something more than just a wave from the server. Below is an
              example of how we might check against <code>ok</code>
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
function getJSON(url) {
    return fetch(url)
        .then(function(response) {
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw Error(response.statusText);
            } else {
                return response.json();
            }
        })
        .catch(function(error) {
            console.log(error);
        });
}
        </code></pre>
            <p>
              If you are uncomfortable with the <code>throw</code> line
              above...go back and revisit the reading in the text about Bugs and
              Errors.

            <h3>Geolocation services</h3>
            <p>
              We would like our app to be able to return earthquakes within a
              certain radius of our current location. In order to do that we
              will need to tap into the
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                >Geolocation API</a
              >. Luckily it is pretty easy to use. Make sure to read through the
              linked page above for more details, but I'll provide this
              function. One thing to note is that the Geolocation API does not
              return a <kbd>Promise</kbd> like Fetch does. It would be nice if
              it did so we could take advantage of the newer promise based
              features of ES2015 and ES2106. Below you will find a simple
              "Promisefied" version of the method to return the current location
              of the user. Add this to your <kbd>utilities.js</kbd> file.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">
const getLocation = function(options) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject, options);
    });
};
            </code></pre>

            <h3>Export the utilities</h3>
            <p>
              We would like our <kbd>utilities.js</kbd> collection to be a
              reusable module. So we need to export our helper functions to be
              used elsewhere. Add an <code>export</code> keyword before each of
              our functions to export them.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">export function getJSON(url) { ...</code></pre>
            <pre><code class="javascript">export const getLocation = function(options){ ...</code></pre>
            <!-- END STEP -->

          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Quakes module</h3>
            <p>
              Now we can start on the <kbd>quakes</kbd> module in the other file
              <kbd>index.js</kbd>. We will want to use our utilities, so let's
              import them:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">import { getJSON, getLocation } from 'utilities.js';</code></pre>
            <p>
              ...then let's add a variable to hold the Base Url for our app. We
              can use the same one we used earlier for testing. Notice that is
              has the start and end times embedded in it. That will work for
              now, but eventually we will probably want those to be able to
              change and so we will remove them from that <code>const</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">const baseUrl ='https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2019-01-01&endtime=2019-02-02';</code></pre>
            <p>
              Make use of our two functions to get the current location from the
              browser...then send that on to the API to request the earthquakes
              within a 100km radius of that location. The URL that you should
              end up with should look like this:
            </p>
            <code class="callout javascript"
              >https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2019-01-01&endtime=2019-03-02&latitude=43.814540699999995&longitude=-111.78491029999999&maxradiuskm=100</code
            >
            <p>
              Construct this URL with the current location from your helper
              function.
            </p>

            <h3>MVC</h3>
            <p>
              Before we take the next steps, let's think a moment about how we
              would like to organize our code. Not taking this time will almost
              always end up in what is known as 'Spaghetti code'. Hard to
              follow, maintain, and understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this project we will use the Model-View-Controller (MVC)
              architecture. It provides a nice separation of concerns and will
              help us stay organized. This is a simple application and so we
              will probably only need one model, one view, and one controller.
              Create three more files in your project called:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><kbd>Quake.js</kbd></li>
              <li><kbd>QuakesView.js</kbd></li>
              <li><kbd>QuakesController.js</kbd></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In MVC models are responsible to handle all of the interactions
              with our data source. They often contain schema information
              describing the data as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Views take information (usually from the Model) and display it in
              whatever format is needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Controllers act as the glue between the model and view. Their job
              is to request information from the model when needed, and pass it
              on to the view to be displayed.
            </p>
            <!-- END STEP -->

            <h3>Quake.js</h3>
            <p>
              Let's begin by building the model: Quake.js. We will use a
              <kbd>class</kbd> to represent our model. I've provided a bit of
              code below to get you started. Copy it into your file.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="javascript">

    // this is where we will store the last batch of retrieved quakes in the model.  I don't always do this...in this case the api doesn't have an endpoint to request one quake.
    this._quakes = [];
  }
  async getEarthQuakesByRadius(position, radius = 100) {
    // use the getJSON function and the position provided to build out the correct URL to get the data we need.  Store it into this._quakes, then return it
    return this._quakes;
  }
  getQuakeById(id) {
    // filter this._quakes for the record identified by id and return it
    return this._quakes.features.filter(item => item.id === id)[0];
  }
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              Notice I took the liberty of importing the
              <code>getJSON</code> function we wrote earlier. We will need it.

            <p>
              Now let's move on to the View. The view should get sent some data,
              then format it and display it in the current page. As before we
              will use a class, and I will give you a head start:

            <pre><code class="javascript">
  // Quake View handler
export default class QuakesView {
  renderQuakeList(quakeList, listElement) {
    //build a list of the quakes...include the title and time of each quake then append the list to listElement. You should also add the id of the quake record as a data- property to the li. ie. &lt;li data-id=""&gt;
    listElement.innerHTML = quakeList.features
    .map(quake => {
      return `<li data-id=${quake.id}>${quake.properties.title}, ${new Date(
        quake.properties.time
      )}</li>`;
    })
    .join('');
  }
  renderQuake(quake, element) {
    const quakeProperties = Object.entries(quake.properties);
    // for the provided quake make a list of each of the properties associated with it. Then append the list to the provided element. Notice the first line of this method. Object.entries() is a slick way to turn an object into an array so that we can iterate over it easier!

                Modules we have to tell the browser that we want to use modules.
                <code>&lt;script src="index.js" type="module" &gt;</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                The other error that pops up often is a file not found for your
                imported modules. If you see this check your file path. You
                probably need to add a './' to the front of your path like this:
                <code>import Quake from './Quake.js';</code>
              </p>
            </div>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Finishing up</h3>
            <p>
              The last step is go back in our model, view, and controller and
              finish writing the methods as indicated in the comments. The two
              first methods to complete should be the
              <code>initPos</code> method from the controller, then the
              <code>getEarthQuakesByRadius</code> method from the model, test
              each method as you finish them.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that work on the rest of the controller or View methods as
              it makes sense. I would recommend following the same
              order...finish a method, then test. It will keep your errors under
              control and make your code easier to troubleshoot.
            </p>

            <h3>Stretch Goals (optional)</h3>
            <p>
              If you want to take this further there are lots of improvements
              that could be made.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                It would be great if we could specify the radius we would like
                to include in the query for earthquakes. Make it so. You might
                also allow the use to indicate the dates they would like to
                search over as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                The styling leaves a lot to be desired on this project. Style it
                up! Make it look and work better.
              </li>
              <li>
                We can drill down into a quake's details...but we currently have
                no way to get back to the list other than a refresh of the page.
                Add a 'Back' button.
              </li>
              <li>
                What if we wanted to add more functionality? A Routing system
                would make this easier. See if you can take the

                from the SPA example app that we did earlier and integrate it
                into this app.

            <p>
              If you have been working for a while and feel stuck. Here is a
              <a

              temptation to copy/paste anything out of it.
