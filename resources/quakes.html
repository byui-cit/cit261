        <hr />

        <p>
          At this point we have learned a lot about coding with Javascript.
          Let's make a simple earthquake watch app to apply what we have
          learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start by creating a simple HTML file. You can use the code below as a
          starting point.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="lang-markup">

            <h3>getJSON function</h3>
            <p>
              We will be fetching data from an external API using
              <kbd>fetch</kbd>. All of the data we will be requesting will be in
              the <kbd>JSON</kbd> format, so let's write a helper function to
              automatically convert the response to that, and add a bit of extra
              error checking as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Open the <kbd>utilities.js</kbd> file and create a function called
              <kbd>getJSON(url)</kbd>. Add the code to make your function do a
              simple fetch request using the <kbd>url</kbd> argument that should
              get passed in, and return the response in JSON.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use

                We will be using earthquake data from the USGS. They have an
                open api that is easy to use. You can find the documentation
                here:

              <h3>Simple Fetch</h3>
              <div>
                <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
function getJSON(url) {
    return fetch(url)
        .then(function(response) {
            return response.json();
        })
}
                </code></pre>
              </div>
            </section>
            <p>
              This is a good start, but it is a bit brittle. Let's add some
              error checking. You should have used a <code>.then()</code> method
              call to process the response of your request. There is another
              method we can use as well: <code>.catch()</code>. We can use this
              to do some checking on how successful our fetch was. We can just
              chain this method after the end of the <code>.then()</code> call.
              Like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
.catch(function(error) {
    console.log(error);
});
        </code></pre>
            <p>
              This is a very simple error handler. Normally you would do
              something about the error, instead of just reporting it. The
              problem with this however, is that Fetch was designed to treat
              <em>any</em> request that communicates successfully with the
              intended destination server as successful, no matter what the
              response is! So we need to add more checking to make sure we
              actually got the results we were looking for before we try to use
              them. Luckily the Fetch response includes an <code>ok</code> flag
              as part of the response. If that is <kbd>true</kbd>, then we get
              got something more than just a wave from the server. Below is an
              example of how we might check against <code>ok</code>
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
function getJSON(url) {
    return fetch(url)
        .then(function(response) {
            if (!response.ok) {
                throw Error(response.statusText);
            } else {
                return response.json();
            }
        })
        .catch(function(error) {
            console.log(error);
        });
}
        </code></pre>
            <p>
              If you are uncomfortable with the <code>throw</code> line
              above...go back and revisit the reading in the text about Bugs and
              Errors.

            <h3>Geolocation services</h3>
            <p>
              We would like our app to be able to return earthquakes within a
              certain radius of our current location. In order to do that we
              will need to tap into the
              <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noreferrer"
                >Geolocation API</a
              >. Luckily it is pretty easy to use. Make sure to read through the
              linked page above for more details, but I'll provide this
              function. One thing to note is that the Geolocation API does not
              return a <kbd>Promise</kbd> like Fetch does. It would be nice if
              it did so we could take advantage of the newer promise based
              features of ES2015 and ES2106. Below you will find a simple
              "Promisefied" version of the method to return the current location
              of the user. Add this to your <kbd>utilities.js</kbd> file.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">
const getLocation = function(options) {
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(resolve, reject, options);
    });
};
            </code></pre>

            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Export the utilities</h3>
            <p>
              We would like our <kbd>utilities.js</kbd> collection to be a
              reusable module. So we need to export our helper functions to be
              used elsewhere. Add an <code>export</code> keyword before each of
              our functions to export them.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">export function getJSON(url) { ... }</code></pre>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">export const getLocation = function(options){ ... }</code></pre>
            <!-- END STEP -->
          </li>
          <li>
            <!-- BEGIN STEP -->
            <h3>Quakes module</h3>
            <p>
              Now we can start on the <kbd>quakes</kbd> module in the other file
              <kbd>index.js</kbd>. We will want to use our utilities, so let's
              import them:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">import { getJSON, getLocation } from 'utilities.js';</code></pre>
            <p>
              ...then let's add a variable to hold the Base Url for our app. We
              can use the same one we used earlier for testing. Notice that is
              has the start and end times embedded in it. That will work for
              now, but eventually we will probably want those to be able to
              change and so we will remove them from that <code>const</code>.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">const baseUrl ='https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2019-01-01&endtime=2019-02-02';</code></pre>
            <p>
              Make use of our two functions to get the current location from the
              browser...then send that on to the API to request the earthquakes
              within a 100km radius of that location. The URL that you should
              end up with should look like this:
            </p>
            <code class="lang-javascript"
              >https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2019-01-01&endtime=2019-03-02&latitude=43.814540699999995&longitude=-111.78491029999999&maxradiuskm=100</code
            >
            <p>
              Construct this URL with the current location from your helper
              function.
            </p>
            <p>
              I would recommend creating a function to do this. Your function
              should look something like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">const baseUrl ='https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/query?format=geojson&starttime=2019-01-01&endtime=2019-02-02';

function testGetQuakesForLocation() {
  // call the getLocation function to get the lat/long

  // use that information to build out the correct URL
  const geoUrl = baseUrl + // add location information here
  // use the url to request the correct quakes 

  //log out the quakes for now.
}
getQuakesForLocation();</code></pre>
            <p>
              This code is for testing only to make sure these parts are
              working. We will remove this function later and do this in another
              part of our code!
            </p>

            <h3>First draft</h3>
            <p>
              Open <kbd>main.js</kbd> (or create it if you did not earlier).
              Copy and paste the following code into that file:

const baseUrl =

let quakes = [];

  const listHtml = quakes.features.map((quake) => {

      quake.properties.time
    )}</div></li>`;
  });
  listElement.innerHTML = listHtml.join("");

      .join("");

everything();
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              Spend a few minutes as a group reviewing that code. Make sure it
              is working...it should ask you for permission to use your
              location, then it will retrieve the earthquakes within 100km of
              tht area. If you want to see recent quakes change the dates in the
              <code>baseUrl</code> variable. If you click on the first line of a
              quake it should pull up the details for that quake.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this code works, it would not be considered good code. It
              breaks several best practices. It should be considered like a
              rough draft. Just as I hope you would not stop at the first draft
              of an essay, you should not stop with your code in such a state.
            </p>
            <p>
              The problems with leaving the code like this deal in a large
              extend with stability and maintainability. For example, what
              happens when we need to add a new feature? There is a good chance
              we will break something while changing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is usually considered good practice to do a few things with our
              code:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>Write small focused functions and classes.</li>
              <li>Have some sort of separation of concerns.</li>
              <li>Make as little as possible public.</li>
              <li>Organize using modules</li>
            </ol>

            <p>
              One example of separation of concerns would be to try and keep the
              code that is responsible for talking to external systems separate
              from code that is responsible for displaying information in the
              web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another example would be the code responsible to get the current
              user location separate from the code the requests earthquakes. The
              earthquake request needs a location to work...but we can make it
              more flexible if we let another part of the program worry about
              getting the location and passing it in.
            </p>
            <p>For this activity we are going to focus primarily on point 1</p>
            <!-- <p>
              We can start with two modules in this case. One for our external
              services, and another to take care of requesting the right quakes
              and rendering them to the browser.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                If you are thinking this sounds familiar...it is a simple take
                on a coding approach called Model-View-Controller (MVC) If you
                have been introduced to this before and would like to approach
                this activity using full MVC...<a href="quakes-mvc.html"
                  >Follow these instructions</a
                >
                and skip to step 5.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>Create two more files in your project called:</p>

              <li><kbd>Render.js</kbd></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If the process to get the user location was more involved we would
              create a module for that as well...but since it is one function we
              can leave it in our <kbd>utilities.js</kbd> module as well as our
              Fetch wrapper function: <code>getJson</code>
            </p>
            <p>
              Views take information (usually from the Model) and display it in
              whatever format is needed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Controllers act as the glue between the model and view. Their job
              is to request information from the model when needed, and pass it
              on to the view to be displayed.

            <h3>Refactor</h3>
            <p>
              Refactoring is a common step in development. It is done with
              working code for the purpose of making the solution more
              performant, more reusable, less brittle, easier to test, and/or
              more maintainable. We want to try and end up with small focused
              functions that do one thing. To help guide you in your refactoring
              below you will find a new function that will replace
              <code>everything();</code>. Use it to help you to know how to
              break up the massive function we started with.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-js">
// We need to refactor the everything function. In the end we want a function like below
// create the appropriate functions, move the functionality from everything() to the functions so that the showQuakes() function below will work.
async function showQuakes() {
  // get the current location
  const location = await initPos();
  // get the list of quakes for the location
  quakes = await getQuakesForLocation(location);
  // render the list to the list element
  const listElement = document.querySelector("#quakeList");
  listElement.innerHTML = generateListMarkup(
    quakes.features,
    earthquakeListTemplate
  );

  // attach a listener to the quakes that will listen for a click and render out details about the quake
  listElement.addEventListener("click", earthQuakeClickHandler);
}
            </code></pre>
            <p>
              Reviewing this new function we can see that we will need to create
              at least the following functions:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <code>initPos()</code>

                <code>generateListMarkup(list, templateCallback)</code>
              </li>
              <li><code>earthQuakeListTemplate(data)</code></li>
              <li><code>earthQuakeClickHandler(event)</code></li>
              <li>...and one more. ????</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Notice what it is not responsible for: getting the location, or
              doing the actual rendering of the html.
            </p>

              We will use a <kbd>class</kbd> to represent our model. I've

              Remember that that earlier I said that the Controller was like the
              glue between the Model and View? Well in order to do that the
              Controller has to know about both. Making our model and view
              Classes and modules will make it easy to do that. As before
              copy/paste the code below into your controller to get started.
            </p>
            <pre><code class="lang-javascript">

            <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
            <p>
              The next step is to let our HTML know about our modules. Import
              your Controller into the <kbd>index.js</kbd> file, create an
              instance of the class (<code>new QuakeController()</code>), then
              call the <code>init()</code> method. You may want to console.log
              something out from that method until we create the methods it
              calls to help us know if everything is working correctly. If there
              are errors, fix them :) If not move on to the next step
            </p>
            <p>
              If you did not remove the function we created earlier to test the
              geolocation and earthquake fetch earlier
              (testGetQuakesForLocation), make sure to do it now.
            </p>
            <div class="callout">
              <p>
                If you get an error that talks about <code>import</code> not
                recognized or something similar...remember that to use ES
                Modules we have to tell the browser that we want to use modules.
                <code>&lt;script src="index.js" type="module" &gt;</code>
              </p>
              <p>
                The other error that pops up often is a file not found for your
                imported modules. If you see this check your file path. You
                probably need to add a './' to the front of your path like this:
                <code>import Quake from './Quake.js';</code>
              </p>

            <h3>Finishing up</h3>
            <p>
              The last step is go back in our model, view, and controller and
              finish writing the methods as indicated in the comments. The two
              first methods to complete should be the
              <code>initPos</code> method from the controller, then the
              <code>getEarthQuakesByRadius</code> method from the model, test
              each method as you finish them.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that work on the rest of the controller or View methods as
              it makes sense. I would recommend following the same
              order...finish a method, then test. It will keep your errors under
              control and make your code easier to troubleshoot.

            <h3>Stretch Goals (optional)</h3>
            <p>
              If you want to take this further there are lots of improvements
              that could be made.
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                It would be great if we could specify the radius we would like
                to include in the query for earthquakes. Make it so. You might
                also allow the use to indicate the dates they would like to
                search over as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                The styling leaves a lot to be desired on this project. Style it
                up! Make it look and work better.
              </li>
              <li>
                We can drill down into a quake's details...but we currently have
                no way to get back to the list other than a refresh of the page.
                Add a 'Back' button.
              </li>
              <li>
                What if we wanted to add more functionality? A Routing system
                would make this easier. See if you can take the
