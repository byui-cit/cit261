            <hr />

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This course is designed to give students the skills required to create mobile web applications for
                modern mobile devices. Because of this, the course focuses on how to solve larger, ill-structured
                business problems by designing and creating applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be run on mobile devices. This course is intended to help you learn to do this without the aid of third-party frameworks or libraries.</p>
            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>CIT 160 - It is expected that you have learned, know, and have mastered all the information made
                    available
                    to you in CIT 160</li>
                <li>CIT 230 - depending on which catalog year you are in, this course may or may not be a prerequisite.
                    Regardless,
                    it is strongly suggested that you learn, know, and have mastered the material from CIT 230 course
                    prior
                    to starting this course.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Course Structure</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>This class has an unusual course design. It is designed to use repetition to help you learn efficiently
                in an environment where the instructor is your mentor rather than a lecturer. Using , HTML5, CSS3, and
                JavaScript you will explore technologies and use them to resolve problems that arise naturally. You
                will also
                learn to find, evaluate, and select solutions to those same problems through creating Single Page Web
                applications</p>
            <p>You will be part of a learning group but there will be no group projects. This is encouraged by
                evaluation
                of your learning, not the team's. To accomplish this, evaluation points have been created for the
                course.
                These consist of personal explorations and projects. You can see what these are and when you will need
                to
                complete them by looking at the Activity Schedule.</p>

            <h3>Activity Schedule</h3>
            <table class="info-table">
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Block Weeks</td>
                        <td>Activity</td>

                </thead>

                    <tr>
                        <td>1:1-3</td>
                        <td>Exploration Phase: Read the assigned chapters. Read them completely and for understanding.
                            Get all the examples working and understood.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>1:4-7</td>
                        <td>Do two web SPA programming challenges</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>2:1-3</td>
                        <td>Exploration Phase: Read the assigned chapters. Read them completely and for understanding.
                            Get all the examples working and understood.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <h4>Exploration Phases</h4>
            <p>These are given to you as a space to start becoming familiar with the programming concepts you learn in
                this
                class. The concepts are explained in detail in the required books. Working examples are also found in
                the
                required books. Get them all working and understood. </p>
            <p>You must read the books for understanding, not just to get them done. Do not give into the temptation to
                just get the examples working without reading. If you do, you will not gain as full an understanding as
                you
                can with the reading.</p>
            <p>The instructor is available every class period and in his office to help you understand the concepts.
                There will be small mini-lectures during the exploration phase at the beginning of each class. These
                are enrichment lectures about the topics you are reading, not a replacement for doing the reading in
                the books.</p>
            <h4>Challenges</h4>
            <p>These are ideas for programs that you come up with. Find a problem in an area you have some level of
                expertise and solve it using the programming concepts you learned during the exploration phase. The
                purpose of the challenges is to help you deeply explore the programming concepts you learned in the
                exploration phases. These are enrichment activities, not initial learning activities. The initial
                learning activities consist of getting the examples in the books working and understood.</p>
            <h3>Reading Schedule</h3>
            <p>This is a minimal reading schedule. You should work to be significantly ahead of what is listed and get
                all
                of the examples in the books working and understood.</p>

            <h2>Outcomes</h2>
            <p>By taking advantage of the opportunities this course presents, you will develop fundamental knowledge
                and
                skills in computing and technology and improve your professional possibilities by:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Becoming more efficient at applying your innate curiosity and creativity,</li>
                <li>Becoming more dexterous at exploring your environment,</li>
                <li>Becoming a person who enjoys helping and learning from others,</li>
                <li>Using a divide and conquer approach to design solutions for programming problems,</li>
                <li>Finding and trouble shooting bugs you and others will have in the code you write, and</li>
                <li>Developing and debugging HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programs that use medium complexity web
                    technologies.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>These outcomes support both the <a href="universityandcitoutcomes.pdf" target="_blank">CIT Department
                    and
                    BYU-Idaho student learning outcomes</a>. The activities and assessments for this course are
                designed
                to give you opportunities to achieve these outcomes and evaluate you against them. If you desire a
                different
                set of evaluations and assignments, you may propose them (during the first or second week of the
                semester)
                to the instructor but your proposal must cover ALL of the course's outcomes in significant ways and to
                a
                significant depth. Do not propose a "checklist" of meaningless activities. These will not be
                approved.
            </p>
            <h2>Learning Model Architecture</h2>
            <h3>Prepare:</h3>
            <p>Each week you will work directly with your team outside of class time. You will help your team become
                successful
                if you come prepared for these team meetings. You should come having thought about the technologies you
                are
                exploring, completed assignments given during the previous team meeting, and having done the necessary
                research
                to plan the next steps for your team. Just as in life, if you do more than fulfill minimum requirements
                assigned
                to you, you will be more successful in your team and in the class. Magnify your professional calling.</p>

            <h3>Teach One Another:</h3>
            <p>Team meetings and a collaborative environment have been established to enable each of you to draw from
                the
                strengths of others so that your weaknesses can become strengths. This requires effort on the part of
                both
                the knower and the learner, so that both may be edified.</p>
            <h3>Ponder/Prove</h3>
            <p>Pondering is integral to success in both this course and life. You should be pondering and reflecting
                not
                only on what you are learning, but also on how you are learning it. Self-understanding is vital to professional
                life.
                It is also fundamental to our eternal exaltation.</p>
            <p>Proving is also integral to success. You should prove what you think you know through experimentation.
                Just
                finding an example of some principle on the web or from your team is insufficient for successful
                learning.
                You must be playing with and generating your own examples to understand how technologies work and what
                they
                do. This way you become a blessing to yourself and your current and future team members.</p>

            <h2>Grading Policy</h2>
            <p>At the end of each challenge, you have an opportunity for me to evaluate, with you, where you are in
                your
                learning and the accomplishment of the outcomes for the course. You must request this review. I will
                not
                force a review with you if you do not request one. You must be proactive in scheduling this
                outside-of-class
                evaluation. The results of this evaluation will not be recorded or become part of your grade.</p>
            <p><strong>At midterm and again at the end of the semester</strong> You will be asked to turn in your ranking
                of
                yourself on the course outcomes, with a portfolio of your work to back yourself up. It is recommended that you
                build
                this as you go. Your final grade will be based off of these two artifacts. Here is an example of one
                take
                on creating a portfolio using a GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261" target="_blank">CIT261

            <h3>From the University Catalog:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>"A" represents outstanding understanding, application, and integration of subject material and
                    extensive
                    evidence of original thinking, skillful use of concepts, and ability to analyze and solve complex
                    problems.
                    Demonstrates diligent application of Learning Model principles, including initiative in serving
                    other
                    students.
                </li>
                <li>“B” represents considerable/significant understanding, application, and incorporation of the
                    material
                    which would prepare a student to be successful in next level courses, graduate school or
                    employment.
                    The student participates in the Learning Model as applied in the course.</li>
                <li>"C" represents sufficient understanding of subject matter. The student demonstrates minimal
                    initiative
                    to be prepared for class. Sequenced courses could be attempted, but mastering new materials might
                    prove
                    challenging. The student participates only marginally in the Learning Model.</li>
                <li>“D” represents poor performance and initiative to learn and understand and apply course materials.
                    Retaking
                    a course or remediation may be necessary to prepare for additional instruction in this subject
                    matter.</li>
                <li>"F" represents failure in the course.</li>
            </ul>




            <h2>Standards</h2>
            <p>Be responsible for your own education. Take responsibility to complete your homework as assigned. Be
                prepared
                to accept the consequences if you do not.</p>
            <p><em>It is important that you prepare yourself each week to contribute actively in learning with your
                    fellow
                    students. Be respectful of each other’s time and be prompt to any meetings that may be scheduled.</em>
