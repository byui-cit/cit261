        <h2>Course outline</h2>
        <p>
          The course is broken up into two units. Unit one is weeks 1-6 and
          consists of 4 weeks of reading and completing exercises from the book,
          then a two week application where the students will complete a self
          selected small coding project. They should plan on about 15 hours for
          their project spent over weeks 5 and 6.
        </p>

        <h3>Team Activities</h3>
        <p>
          During most weeks the students will have a required team activity that
          they should complete in a peer programming style. You can decide
          whether to form the groups yourself, or allow the students to self
          select. They should plan on a 1 hour block per week where they will
          need to meet to complete the activity. I recommend 3-4 students per
          group. Most of the points for these activities come from
          participation...only about 10% or so is for completion.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you decide you form the groups for the students, here are some
          resources to help with that:
        </p>

        <h3>Unit 2</h3>
        <p>
          Unit two is weeks 7-14 and is made up of another 3 weeks of reading
          and exercises and then 4 weeks of application. The students again will
          select an application that they would like to build. They should spend
          more time preparing a project plan this time however. If they did not
          get everything done on the first coding challenge that they wanted to
          and there is enough left to do I think it would be fine to allow them
          to continue the unit one project into unit 2. That is up to you. They
          should plan on 30 hours for this project.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the reading weeks remind the students often that if they only read
          through the material once and then move on they will not gain the
          understanding they need and will struggle in other parts of the
          course. They should not look at the assigned readings and say "Great!
          Two chapters to read...I can finish this week's work in a hour or two
          and move on!" They should instead plan on reading and re-reading,
          completing exercises, looking for alternative sources on the material,
          etc until they have mastered the topic(s).
        </p>
        <h2>Instructor Time expectations</h2>
        <p>
          The course is designed to minimize the amount of time you spend
          grading to allow for more time teaching and giving individualized
          attention to students that need it. Each week the students are
          required to turn in either notes or worked exercises. You should
          review those with the goal of extracting questions to address with the
          class. They will also submit a weekly report of status. Again, review
          these looking for students whom you may need to reach out to. I would
          grade both of these on completion. Feel free to dock a few points on
          the notes if you feel they are putting in minimal effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should plan on holding an office hour each week. Record this for
          those that can't make it. Use this time to answer any questions you
          find in the notes or that the students attending bring, and then work
          on a coding example illustrating skills from the readings. Each week
          in the notes I'll give an example project...use mine or feel free to
          come up with your own.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also consider preparing a short video introduction for each
          week to help the students plan their time.
        </p>
        <h2>Final grades</h2>
        <p>
          The grading for the course is a bit different. 30% of the grade will
          be made up of the weekly notes and team actities. The other 70% will
          be based off of a self evaluation that the student performs. They will
          assess themselves on how well they have achieved the outcomes of the
          course, prepare a short video with their justifications, and then
          provide a portfolio of work to back up their claims. You should review
          their marks and their submitted work and adjust as necessary.
