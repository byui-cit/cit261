        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This week will be about review. It will also be about introducing the
          course. There is no team activity for this week, and most of the
          student's time will be spent working through the Doing Stuff book. 90%
          of the material in that book is intended to be review...but it feels
          new to too many students. They might panic a bit when they pull it
          down and look at the pages, but once they get into it, they should
          move quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Make sure the students understand the grading structure. 30% comes
          from reading and team activities. 70% from self evaluation and
          portfolio. The self evaluations will happen twice: once at midterm,
          and once at the end of the semester.
        </p>
        <p>
          Help them to understand that the readings are important, and they get
          to choose how to best spend their time. If they learn best by just
          reading then you should expect detailed notes from them. If they learn
          best by experimentation and doing, then you should expect exercises
          that have been worked through. They have the option but
          <strong>should plan on spending adequate time during the week</strong>
          to learn the material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage them also to look to other sources when things don't make
          sense. The book does a pretty good job, but the way it addresses some
          topics might be confusing to some students. Help them to remember that
          there are other options. Several are listed in this weeks reading in
          fact. The notes they turn in do not have to be all from the assigned
          reading.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>

        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          For your meeting with them you might consider running through an
          exercise building a basic html file...talk about the parts and why
          each are important. Then build and style a basic form as review. The
          course does not spend a lot of time teaching CSS, but students are
          expected to style their applications. A review would probably be
          welcomed by many students.
          <a href="../examples/form-demo.html" target="_blank"
            >Here is an example form</a
          >
          you could use as part of your demo.
        </p>
        <p>
          You could also spend some time discussing the material in the Design
          video that is listed in the readings for the week.
        </p>
        <p>Here are a few website examples you could talk through as well.</p>
