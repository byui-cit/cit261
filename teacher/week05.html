        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week is build design and build a simple
          organized application using ESModules and classes. The students will
          take the code from the Hikes demo if you shared it as a starting
          point. The discussion they have at the beginning is probably as
          important as the actual implementation. You may need to say a few
          words organizing code to help get them started on their discussions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reading assignment for this week is smaller to allow time to start
          on the first challenge. This one will be given them. It is to build a
          simple <a href="../resources/todo.html" target="_blank">Todo App</a>.
          Be prepared to answer questions about this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Encourage the students also to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          Keep your comments short this week in your meeting to allow for
          students to ask questions about their projects. It would probably be
          helpful to give more examples of using the browser to
          debug...breakpoints, stepping, etc. Here is a simple module that
          builds a
          <a href="../examples/datepicker.html" target="_blank">datepicker</a>
          for browsers that don't support the new <kbd>date</kbd> type for
          inputs (ie Safari). Points to bring up:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Show how the <code>debugger;</code> statement can be used to stop
            the code execution, as well as how to set a breakpoint in the
            developer tools of the browser.
          </li>
          <li>Once the code is paused show how to step over, step in.</li>
          <li>
            Explain how we can follow the execution of an application with
            stepping. You might step into a few functions and then draw
            attention to the call stack and explain the significance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inspect the values of variables and objects, talk about how we are
            looking to see if the values match what we expect...if not how can
            we figure out why?
          </li>
          <li>
            You might also point out lines 128-130 in <kbd>datepicker.js</kbd>.
            It is testing to see if the browser supports the
            <code>date</code> type and doing something if it doesn't.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have time show examples of other ways to avoid errors in our
            code such as if statements checking for the existance of data before
            we try to use it and using try/catch blocks to deal with errors more
            gracefully.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          A word about project planning would be good here as well. Encourage
          the students to spend some time thinking through their project before
          they jump into the code. Encourage them to build a wireframe or two to
          help them remember and apply the design principles discussed in the
          first week of class.
