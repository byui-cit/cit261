        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week has the students use a third-party
          API. They will be pulling data from
          <a href="http://swapi.co" target="_blank">swapi.co</a>. They will need
          to remember how to deal with the promises that Fetch will return. The
          solution is given with promises and with async/await.
        </p>

        <p>
          Also, encourage the students to record their questions while reading
          and give them to you to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          The reading for this week introduces CSS transitions and animations.
          An example I often use is to start with
          <a href="https://codepen.io/matkat/pen/EKaNZg" target="_blank"
            >these boxes</a
          >
          and will change them (transform, size shape color, location) with
          transitions to demo the basics. You can finish with a bouncing ball or
          make a box go around the content div (slide corner to corner all the
          way around). Then you might build something like this:
          <a href="../examples/poketest.html" target="_blank">PokeApi Demo</a>
          to review Ajax and add the sliding transition effect.
