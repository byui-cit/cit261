        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          The team activity for this week tries to pull together most of what we
          have learned this semester by building an app that will get the
          current location, then pull a list of earth quakes within a certain
          distance of that location from an API and displays them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Remind students that they should be working on their personal
          challenges. The only assignment this week is the team activity (~1hr)
          so they should plan on spending the rest of their time working on
          their projects. (~7-8 hrs).
        </p>
        <h2>Meeting Time</h2>

        <p>
          This week you could use your meeting for questions on projects. You
          should also spend a few minutes talking about using fetch to put/post.
          We will need to send in some request options in this case and cannot
          rely on the defaults. You could work towards something like this:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/byui-cit/cit261/tree/gh-pages/examples/week10"
            >USDA search example</a
          >. You will need to get an API key from
          <a
            href="https://fdc.nal.usda.gov/index.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >USDA Food Data Central</a
          >, then add a file called <kbd>keys.js</kbd> to that project with your
          api key in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Great opportunity to pull up the reading on Fetch from this week to
          talk about using a settings object to customize a fetch call, and of
          trying to make sense of API documentation. Also discuss using the
          <kbd>.gitignore</kbd> file to protect things like API keys.
